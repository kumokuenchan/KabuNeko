# Optional Dependencies for Stock Analysis Toolkit
#
# These are OPTIONAL and not required for core functionality
#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: These packages may not support Python 3.14+
# As of December 2024:
# - TensorFlow supports Python 3.9-3.12
# - pandas-ta requires numba (Python 3.10-3.13)
# - XGBoost may have limited support
#
# If you have Python 3.14+, you have these options:
# 1. Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 for full compatibility
# 2. Wait for packages to add Python 3.14 support
# 3. Skip these optional features (core toolkit still works!)
